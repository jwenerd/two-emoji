Two Emoji
=========================

Two Emoji is a experimental digital bot thing that takes the bumper sticker like and often attributed to Ghandi quote `"Be the change that you wish to see in the world."` but replaces the words `"change"` and `"world"` with a randomly selected emoji character.

Every morning slightly before 9am EST, the bot will post to the [Two Emoji Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/twoemoji/) a brief affirmative intro text followed by the `"be the ___" ` statement.  

The intention is that the bot inspires others to start their day with an upbeat, self-care inspiring message and a reminder that one can be utterly anything (🐴, 🌵, 📫, 🤠, etc.) in the anything (🤷‍♀️, 😥, 🛀, 🍭, etc.) that they wish to see in their community, life, and the universe!
